    "- Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn't seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy.  IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival.  Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.\n",

    "In the above code cell, I attempted to utilize plenty of Pandas utilities. I created my own dataset instead of using one from online, and gathered data based on 2023 NFL Quarterback Prospects straight out of college. I got data on the top 12 quarterbacks from this years draft, and used multiple sources to fact check the data that I was inputting. In this case, the three columns in the data were their height, weight, and quarterback ranking based on multiple analysts' picks. I sorted this data and used Panda to list the top 5 quarterback heights, the biggest and smallest quarterbacks, the average quarterback height, the median quarterback weight, and something unique that I did was that I used the descriptive statistics function unique to Panda to list all of the IQR ranges, max values, etc based on the created dataset. All of the data was stored in nfl.json, a readable file. "
