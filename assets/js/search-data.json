Some of these algorithms would have broken my computer if they hadn&#39;t been stopped. . Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. . There are many sorting algorithms and each is more efficient than the other. Some sorting algorithms include insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, bulk sort and quick sort algorithm. Out of these 6, the 3 most efficient sorting algorithms are merge sort, bulk sort and quick sort. . Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? . Time complexity is important when choosing an algorithm because you want an algorithm that can be easily run without taking too much time to produce results. Spatial complexity is also important because you need an algorithm that can handle large amounts of data. . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? . Constant time algorithms can be good most of the time, but they should not always be used, as there may be algorithms that can take even less time. I would almost never use an exponential time algorithm because they are almost always incredibly inefficient. For 512 inputs, the linear algorithm can take 512 seconds, while the exponential algorithm takes 1.34 x 10^154 seconds. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm’s time and space complexity . Time complexity is essentially determined by how long an algorithm takes depending on the number of inputs to the algorithm. The space complexity is defined by f(N), where N is the size of the input data. . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Finished .",

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? | . A connection object is an object that is created using the sqlite3.connect() method to connect to a SQLite database. It represents a connection to a database file and provides methods to execute SQL commands and interact with the database. After looking it up, I think that the connection object acts like a network connection by functioning as a connection to the database. . Same for cursor object? | . The cursor object is used to execute SQL commands and fetch data from the database. It acts as a pointer to a specific row or a set of rows in the database. . The cursor object allows the application to execute SQL commands and retrieve data from the database by providing methods such as execute() and fetchall(). The execute() method is used to execute an SQL command and the fetchall() method is used to fetch all the data retrieved from the database. . Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | . For the conn object, I see that some of its attributes include in_transaction, isolation_level, and row_factory. For the cursor object, I see that some of its attributes include arraysize, lastrowid, row_factory, and rowcount. . Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | . Yes, &quot;results&quot; is an object because it not only appears under the the list of local variables, but it also includes data used as a part of the functionality of the program. It includes the attributes of each user, such as their name, their uid, and their date of birth. . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | . The create() function in the OOP was called on an object. The imperative version involves creating numerous variables within the function rather than the objects. Both of these have their own pros and cons. The imperative version is less error prone, but also less efficient. The converse is true for the create() in the OOP version. Imperative version does not censor your password. Using OOP might be easier if one is trying to work with large amounts of data. If one is trying to work with a small amount of data, imperative might work better. . Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . The purpose of the SQL INSERT statement in this code is to insert a new row of data into the &quot;users&quot; table of a SQLite database. The INSERT INTO statement specifies the name of the table and the columns where the data should be inserted, and the VALUES clause provides the values to be inserted into those columns. The ? placeholders are used to prevent SQL injection attacks by sanitizing user input. . The INSERT INTO statement in this code is similar to the init method of a User class in that both are used to create a new record or object in the database. However, there are some differences. The INSERT INTO statement only inserts data into a table in the database, while the init method of a User class creates a new instance of a class in memory. . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | . The &quot;hacked&quot; part in the code is meant to provide a password that meets the minimum length requirement (2 characters) for security purposes. The message variable is set to &quot;hacked&quot; in this case to indicate that the password was automatically set. . Explain try/except, when would except occur? | . The try/except block is used to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the SQL command. In this case, the try block contains the SQL command to update the password for the specified user, and the except block catches any sqlite3. Error exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the command. If an exception occurs, the code inside the except block is executed. . What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . The code that connects to the database and creates a cursor object is repeated in each of these examples. This is because it is necessary to establish a connection to the database in order to execute SQL commands. The cursor object is used to execute the SQL commands and interact with the database. Once the SQL commands have been executed, the cursor and connection objects need to be closed to free up resources and prevent memory leaks. . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #update() . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | . DELETE can be a dangerous operation if used carelessly as it permanently removes data from the database, and if it is used with caution, it can result in unintended data loss or corruption. . In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . The &quot;f&quot; before the string is used for f-strings, which are a way of formatting strings that allows you to include the values of variables directly in the string. The curly braces {} surrounding uid indicate that the value of the uid variable should be inserted at that position in the string. This provides a much easier alternative than .format() . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | . The menu repeats so that if the user would like to perform multiple operations in one sitting (create and red for example), they can do so. They can perform as many operations as they would like until they don&#39;t input anything or make the program exit. . Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . Yes, I could refactor this menu with a list, such as perhaps using list comprehension in Python. . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) .

Complement this with Debugging example. | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project. | . | . Reference... sqlite documentation . Procedural Abstraction Question . Recalling the College Board criteria, procedural abstraction refers to the concept of breaking down a program into a set of code blocks or functions that perform specific tasks. These procedures or functions can be called from various parts of the program as needed, without the calling code having to know the internal details of how the function works. I can see procedural abstraction being used in this implementation, as there are separate functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records in the database. The menu function acts as a controller that allows the user to choose which operation they want to perform. For example, in the create() function, it prompts the user to enter the required details, connects to the database, creates a cursor object, executes an SQL command to insert the data into the database, and then closes the cursor and connection objects. This entire process occurs by calling the create() function. Overall, since there are multiple functions with specific tasks included in this implementation, there is definitely procedural abstraction being used here. . Data Abstraction Question . Recalling the College Board criteria, data abstraction is essentially representing something (i.e a program) in a much more simplified, condensed method while hiding its more internal functions. Looking at this implementation, I do see data abstraction in this implementation. The implementation hides the details of the underlying database operations from the user, providing a simple interface for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their data. The user interacts with the program through a menu system, which hides the implementation details from the user and provides an abstraction of the available operations. . For example, when the user selects the &quot;create&quot; operation from the menu, they are prompted for the necessary information (name, uid, password, dob), and the implementation takes care of inserting this information into the database. . Regarding debugging, one possible example is if the user enters invalid input (e.g., a non-existent uid when updating or deleting a user). In this case, the implementation catches the exception raised by the database operation and prints an error message to the user. The error message provides a high-level explanation of the problem (&quot;No uid was found in the table&quot;), without revealing the underlying implementation details. This is an example of data abstraction, as the implementation is hiding the details of the database operation (in this case, the SQL query) from the user and providing a simplified, high-level interface for working with the data. . Debugging Screenshots . from PIL import Image debug = Image.open(&#39;../images/attributes.png&#39;) debug1 = Image.open(&#39;../images/conncursor.png&#39;) display(debug) display(debug1) . Debugging Screenshots Analysis . In the first screenshot, I showed an example of what the code does if I choose the create operation (&#39;C&#39;). As you can see, when I am in debug mode, on the bottom left, you can see what I typed in for each of the different attributes, such as the date of birth, my password, and some of the other attributes. As I was doing that, the debugger highlighted what part of the code block was being executed in that moment, which allowed me to have a greater understand of what code does as it is being ran. In addition, as I step into more and more, you can see that the objects conn and cursor appear on the top left as well. The attributes for each of those objects can also be seen as well. Overall, playing around with the debugging provided me with a much better and more thorough understanding of how we are able to run and execute code so that it fulfills its purpose of providing us with the desired output. .

EXPLANATION: . In the code box above, I tried using many Pandas helpers. Instead of using an online dataset, I created my own dataset and pulled the 2023 NFL Quarterback Prospects data directly from the university. I obtained information on the top 12 quarterbacks from this year&#39;s draft and used multiple sources to verify the information I entered. In this case, the three columns of data were their height, weight and quarterback rank based on multiple analysts. I sorted through this data and used Panda to list the top five quarterback heights, tallest and shortest quarterbacks, average quarterback height, average quarterback weight, and something unique that I did was use a descriptive statistics function unique to Panda to list. all IQR ranges, maximum values, etc. based on the generated dataset. All data was saved in nfl.json which is a readable file. .",

Solution: Lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not. . HACK #3 - PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS . import numpy as np from PIL import Image # Load the image image = Image.open(&quot;../images/effeltower.jpg&quot;) image.info[&#39;Title&#39;] = &#39;Eiffel Tower&#39; image.info[&#39;Author&#39;] = &#39;Shaurya Goel&#39; image.info[&#39;Year&#39;] = &#39;2023&#39; img_array = np.asarray(image) binary_pixels = np.unpackbits(img_array, axis=-1) hex_pixels = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: hex(int(&#39;&#39;.join(map(str, x)), 2))[2:].zfill(2), -1, binary_pixels) blue_image = np.copy(img_array) blue_image[:, :, 1] = 0 blue_image[:, :, 0] = 0 blue_image = Image.fromarray(blue_image) resized_image = blue_image.resize((blue_image.width // 4, blue_image.height // 4)) display(resized_image) . PARADIGM EXPLANATION: . In this HACK, I made an effort to use bluescale (a different byte manipulation technique), print metadata (vital information about the image), and alter the image&#39;s size using scaling techniques. I used a photograph I took, effeltower.jpg, and used the blue image program to convert it to a blue image by setting the green and blue channels to 0 (in &quot;RGB&quot;). Three printed pieces of image metadata were also added by me. This information contained the image&#39;s title, the photographer&#39;s name, and the year it was shot. When a jpg/jpeg file is compressed, additional metadata with the notation &quot;jfif&quot; is present. . TWO IMAGES REPRESENTING LOSSY AND LOSSLESS COMPRESSION: . Lossy = lassen-volcano.jpg | Lossless = green-square-16.png | . The lossy compression example will be the lassen-volcano.jpg image. This is owing to the fact that image file compression will undoubtedly result in a significantly smaller file size, but it will also result in a decrease in image quality because of the image&#39;s fine details and range of colors. It&#39;s probably going to get fuzzier.On the other hand, the green-square-16.png image can be used as an illustration of lossless compression. Because there is only one color in that image, the RGB pixel values will always be the same (without any intentional alteration of the image), the image quality will not change even though the image file size will reduce. .",

            "content": "MCQ Reflection and Blog . Overall score . . I got questions 17,29, and 50 wrong. | . ## Correcting Wrong Answers . ### Question 17 . . You had to choose one of two answers to this question. I chose the first option (A) correctly, but I chose Option B in error. When I reread the question, I saw that Option D contained a nested if-else statement that, unlike Option B, produced the same outcome as the question’s initial description (val1 &amp; not val2). . Question 29 . . The correct answer is A not B, because as it roates three times it will be facing downward. Furthermore, it will be in middle of the grid as the code goes to completion. . Question 50 . . The answer to the above-given question is option D. - Letter V . Further information and research on ASCII character encoding: . An international standard for encoding the Latin script was developed with the help of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). ASCII was first established in 1963 to enable the interpretation of data between computers. Symbols, numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and some instructions are represented. A radix-2 number system needs 7 bits since ASCII is encoded using 1s and 0s. Characters can be encoded using 2 to the power of 7 = 128 different number combinations with 7 bits. . Since ASCII only uses 7 bits to encode characters, using 8 bits in computing technology required the inclusion of additional bits. With this extra digit, extended ASCII up to 256 characters can be encoded. . As can be seen in the ASCII table above, ASCII encodes the specified 128 characters as 7-bit integers and was initially based on the (modern) English alphabet. One can print 95 of the encoded characters. These consist of the numbers 0 through 9, the letters lowercase a through z, uppercase a through z, and punctuation. The original ASCII specification also included 33 teletype machine-derived control codes that were not readable. Although the most of these are no longer in use, some are. Tab, line feed, and carriage return codes. . A lowercase letter, for instance, is represented by 1101001 in binary, 69 in hex (where I is the ninth character), and 105 in decimal in the ASCII encoding. American standard, however the cent () doesn’t have a code point in ASCII. Additionally, it does not accept proper nouns with diacritical marks, such as Beyoncé, or English phrases with diacritical marks, such resume or jalapeo. . Overall Reflection . Overall, I’m pleased with my grade because it demonstrates both my knowledge of the material covered in this class thus far and my ability to respond intelligently to multiple-choice questions of this type. The questions I misunderstood were also a teaching moment for me because they helped me understand how to approach issues of that nature going forward to avoid repeating my errors. Given that they nearly always result in real learning experiences for me, I enjoy having the chance to test myself on what we have studied so far and see how well I do. These kinds of exams let me know where my areas of strength and weakness lie and how I may strengthen those areas. I sincerely hope that when it comes time for this trimester’s multiple-choice final, I will demonstrate significant progress in how I respond to MCQ questions. .",
