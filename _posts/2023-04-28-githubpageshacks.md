Github pages is a hosting service website. Search up another hosting service website other than Github's and write at least one benefit, advantage, or feature at is different from other hosting service websites.

**One alternative to Github Pages is Netlify, which is a popular hosting service that specializes in static sites and applications. One advantage of using Netlify is its built-in continuous deployment feature, which allows you to automatically deploy your site whenever you push changes to your code repository (e.g., on Github). This can save you time and effort compared to manually deploying your site each time you make changes. Additionally, Netlify provides features such as form handling, serverless functions, and custom domain support, which can enhance the functionality of your site.**
