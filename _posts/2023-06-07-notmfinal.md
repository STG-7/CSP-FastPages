# My Project (SportsGames)

Our N@TM project, SportsGames, was an exciting venture that allowed us to channel our passion for sports into a unique parody of ESPN. We aimed to create a platform that catered to fellow sports enthusiasts, integrating our love for soccer (UCL), basketball (NBA), and American football (NFL). One of the highlights of our project was the incorporation of intriguing statistics that would captivate the interest of other sports fans. We meticulously curated data on player performances, team rankings, and historical records, providing users with a comprehensive and engaging sports experience. Through SportsGames, we aimed to bring a fresh perspective to sports coverage, infusing humor and creativity to make it a standout destination for sports enthusiasts.

# Other CSP Projects

## Assortment of Games

This application's major goals were to amuse users with games and provide them the opportunity to comment on the website. The frontend's level of depth and interactivity astounded me. I was curious about how the project determined the average rating from all of the evaluations submitted by users.

It is a variation of GeoGuesser, with the exception that it displays images of locations all throughout the DNHS campus.
