# My Project (SportsGames)

Our N@TM project, SportsGames, was an exciting venture that allowed us to channel our passion for sports into a unique parody of ESPN. We aimed to create a platform that catered to fellow sports enthusiasts, integrating our love for soccer (UCL), basketball (NBA), and American football (NFL). One of the highlights of our project was the incorporation of intriguing statistics that would captivate the interest of other sports fans. We meticulously curated data on player performances, team rankings, and historical records, providing users with a comprehensive and engaging sports experience. Through SportsGames, we aimed to bring a fresh perspective to sports coverage, infusing humor and creativity to make it a standout destination for sports enthusiasts.

# Other CSP Projects

## Assortment of Games

This application's major goals were to amuse users with games and provide them the opportunity to comment on the website. The frontend's level of depth and interactivity astounded me. I was curious about how the project determined the average rating from all of the evaluations submitted by users.

## Nighthawk Guesser 

It is a variation of GeoGuesser, with the exception that it displays images of locations all throughout the DNHS campus.

Furthermore, the implementation of backend functionalities, such as data storage and retrieval, demonstrates their proficiency in handling complex data structures and algorithms. The efficient and scalable architecture they  employed ensures smooth gameplay and seamless transitions, highlighting their expertise in backend development.

# Final NATM Reflection

As I conclude this reflection, I carry with me a renewed sense of purpose and a deep appreciation for the wonders of computer science. The Night at the Museum experience has served as a reminder that computer science is not just about algorithms and code; it is a dynamic and ever-evolving field that touches every aspect of our lives.

I am grateful for the opportunity to explore the interplay between technology and our human existence, and I am excited to embark on a future where computer science continues to push the boundaries of what is possible. The Night at the Museum has not only deepened my understanding of the field but has also sparked a lifelong passion to contribute to its advancement and impact.
