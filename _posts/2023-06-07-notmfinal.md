# MCQ Reflection and Blog

Our N@TM project, SportsGames, was an exciting venture that allowed us to channel our passion for sports into a unique parody of ESPN. We aimed to create a platform that catered to fellow sports enthusiasts, integrating our love for soccer (UCL), basketball (NBA), and American football (NFL). One of the highlights of our project was the incorporation of intriguing statistics that would captivate the interest of other sports fans. We meticulously curated data on player performances, team rankings, and historical records, providing users with a comprehensive and engaging sports experience. Through SportsGames, we aimed to bring a fresh perspective to sports coverage, infusing humor and creativity to make it a standout destination for sports enthusiasts.

 - I got questions 17,29, and 50 wrong.

 ## Correcting Wrong Answers

 ### Question 17

**You had to choose one of two answers to this question. I chose the first option (A) correctly, but I chose Option B in error. When I reread the question, I saw that Option D contained a nested if-else statement that, unlike Option B, produced the same outcome as the question's initial description (val1 & not val2).**

### Question 29

**The correct answer is A not B, because as it roates three times it will be facing downward. Furthermore, it will be in  middle of the grid as the code goes to completion.**

### Question 50

**The answer to the above-given question is option D. - Letter V**

Further information and research on ASCII character encoding:

An international standard for encoding the Latin script was developed with the help of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). ASCII was first established in 1963 to enable the interpretation of data between computers. Symbols, numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and some instructions are represented. A radix-2 number system needs 7 bits since ASCII is encoded using 1s and 0s. Characters can be encoded using 2 to the power of 7 = 128 different number combinations with 7 bits.

Since ASCII only uses 7 bits to encode characters, using 8 bits in computing technology required the inclusion of additional bits. With this extra digit, extended ASCII up to 256 characters can be encoded.

As can be seen in the ASCII table above, ASCII encodes the specified 128 characters as 7-bit integers and was initially based on the (modern) English alphabet. One can print 95 of the encoded characters. These consist of the numbers 0 through 9, the letters lowercase a through z, uppercase a through z, and punctuation. The original ASCII specification also included 33 teletype machine-derived control codes that were not readable. Although the most of these are no longer in use, some are. Tab, line feed, and carriage return codes.

A lowercase letter, for instance, is represented by 1101001 in binary, 69 in hex (where I is the ninth character), and 105 in decimal in the ASCII encoding. American standard, however the cent () doesn't have a code point in ASCII. Additionally, it does not accept proper nouns with diacritical marks, such as Beyonc√©, or English phrases with diacritical marks, such resume or jalapeo.


## Overall Reflection

**Overall, I'm pleased with my grade because it demonstrates both my knowledge of the material covered in this class thus far and my ability to respond intelligently to multiple-choice questions of this type. The questions I misunderstood were also a teaching moment for me because they helped me understand how to approach issues of that nature going forward to avoid repeating my errors. Given that they nearly always result in real learning experiences for me, I enjoy having the chance to test myself on what we have studied so far and see how well I do. These kinds of exams let me know where my areas of strength and weakness lie and how I may strengthen those areas. I sincerely hope that when it comes time for this trimester's multiple-choice final, I will demonstrate significant progress in how I respond to MCQ questions.**
